This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# figure out two lines' intersection
# 3x + 2y = 7
# -6x + 6y = 6
# paramater matrix
pm <- matrix(c(3,2,-6,6),nrow=2,byrow=T)
result <- matrix(c(7,6),nrow=2)
pt <- solve(pm) %*% result
x <- pt[1]
y <- pt[2]
```
and then, I *test* the function of R that calculate the range, mean, median and sd value.

```{r}
myfunction <- function(x=rnorm(10)){
  if (!is.vector(x))
    print("please check your inpur!!!")
  result <- list(range=range(x), mean=mean(x), median=median(x),sd=sd(x))
  print(result)
}
```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
